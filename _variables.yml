summary:
  summary: I am a solution engineer with a passion for data, leadership, and empowering
    those around me to be the best version of themselves. Regardless of the level
    of complexity, I believe undertanding the why and how of a solution is paramount.
    This enables me to deepdive into the problem with the objective of learning something
    to teach as opposed to learning something to work. Passing on the knowledge I
    learn is as important as acquiring it. I am more interested in how people returned
    from the hunt with blue berries then pointing out the reasons why others didn’t.
